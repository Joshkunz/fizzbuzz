FizzBuzz is a simple programming game with the following rules:

For every number `i` in the range [1..100], if `i` is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz', if `i` is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz', if `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'. Otherwise, print `i`.

The output from a FizzBuzz program should look something like this:

<pre>
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
...
FizzBuzz
16
</pre>

and so on...

The code in this repository is a collection of FizzBuzz scripts 
I've written in different languages I know. 
FizzBuzz is often one of the first programs I write
when learning a new language, so I'll 
add most likely keep adding to this repository
as I learn new languages.

Each file should have a note, explaining what language it's written in,
how to run it on a \*nix system, and possibly a link to an online REPL.
