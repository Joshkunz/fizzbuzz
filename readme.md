A FizzBuzz program is one that produces output matching the following
criteria:

Print the numbers 1 through 100. If a number is divisible by 3 
print 'Fizz' after the number. If a number is divisible by 5 print 'Buzz'
after the number. And last, if a number is divisible by 3 and 5 print 'FizzBuzz'
after the number.

The output should look something like this:

<pre>
1
2
3 Fizz
4
5 Buzz
6 Fizz
...
15 FizzBuzz
16
</pre>

and so on...

The code in this repository, is a collection of FizzBuzz scripts 
I've written in the languages
I've learned over the years. FizzBuzz is often one of the first programs I write
in a new language, so I'll add most likely keep adding to this repository
as I learn new languages.

Each file should have a note, explaining what language it's written in,
how to run it on a \*nix system, and possibly a link to an online repl.
